## Presentation Overview

The presentation outlines a novel approach to stock price prediction using a hybrid deep learning model. The key idea is to move beyond single-source analysis and integrate multiple data streams for more accurate and robust predictions.

The core of the work involves:

* Combining **historical price data**, **company financial fundamentals**, and **news sentiment analysis** into a single model.
* Utilizing an **LSTM network** for time-series forecasting.
* Implementing **FinBERT**, a specialized language model, to extract market sentiment from financial news articles.
* Demonstrating the improved accuracy of this hybrid approach compared to traditional methods.
